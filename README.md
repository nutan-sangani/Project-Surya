Project-Surya
Smell from a new book adores some people, but the dust on the old books does good to whom?

This website is built to be a platform on which people who have books and other similar study materials and wish to donate it, can donate them to other learners, so that it extends the lifetime of a book, saves some trees from falling, as well as provide education to all through books, because we are of the thinking that, books are the ultimate source of knowledge and everyone deserves a chance to make their life brighter.

This Project is named surya, since we want it to spread into every students life and also to make each and every life better and brighter and to also show gratitude to our beloved lord surya.
